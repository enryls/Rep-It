# Rep-It
Starting from a friend's need, i want to start an experiment about a simple operation that is not featured in "Office" Softwares.
The basic idea is to repeat for a n times (with an input value selected by the user) a command (also selected with input by user).
The command start after a certain time (also selected by user).

Actually i've implemented the code starting from the instict, so i'm pretty sure that there is a better way to do this.
